      <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>PyCon CZ</strong> is a community conference intended for networking and
        collaboration in the developer community.
      </p>

      <p>
        We value the participation of <strong>each member</strong> of the
        <strong>Python community</strong> and want all attendees to have
        an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
        Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show
        <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>courtesy</strong> to other
        attendees throughout the conference and at all official conference
        events sponsored by PyCon CZ.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, organizers,
        volunteers or other persons at any official PyCon CZ event are required
        to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce
        this code throughout the event.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-short-version">The Short Version</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>PyCon CZ</strong> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
        physical appearance, body size, disability, race, ethnicity, religion,
        or otherwise. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
        in any form, on-line or off-line.
      </p>

      <p>
        All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
        including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
        imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
        professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
        exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyCon CZ.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If a person engages in harassing behaviour, the organizers will take
          prompt action, including expulsion from PyCon CZ event without a refund.
          Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="the-longer-version">The Longer Version</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, offensive verbal
        comments, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
        physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
          comply immediately.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Sponsor and vendor booths or similar activities are also subject to the
        anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and vendors should not
        use sexualized images, activities, or other offensive material. Booth
        staff (including volunteers) should not wear sexualized
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
        environment. No alcoholic beverages may be served at the booths.
      </p>

      <p>
        Be careful with the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
        and other exclusionary jokes may be offensive to those around you.
        Excessive swearing and offensive jokes, excessive alcohol consumption,
        and use of illegal drugs are not appropriate for PyCon CZ.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of
          Conduct, the conference organizers will take an appropriate action,
          including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
          refund.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h2>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference
        staff. Conference staff will be visibly marked.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact any of these
        organizers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Max Kovykov</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants provide escorts,
        contact local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing
        harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value
        your attendance.
      </p>

      <h2 id="incident-handling">Attendee Incident Handling Procedure</h2>
      <p>
        1. Keep in mind that all conference staff will be wearing a conference
        t-shirt/button with the word “STAFF” on it (or otherwise clearly marked
        as staff). The staff will also be prepared to handle the incidents. All
        our staff are informed about the code of conduct policy and guide for
        handling harassment at the conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a
        conference staff member PRIVATELY. All reports are confidential. Please
        do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff
        have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as
        much for your safety and protection as it is for other attendees.
      </p>

      <p>
        When reporting the incident to the staff, try to gather as much
        information as available but do not interview people about the incident.
        Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The important information consists of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing.</li>
        <li>The behaviour that was in violation.</li>
        <li>The approximate time of the behaviour.</li>
        <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident.</li>
        <li>Other people involved in the incident.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to
        further proceed with the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or
        security only at the victim's request. If you do feel your safety is in
        jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by
        dialing 112 (international emergency number) or 158 (czech number for
        police). Both numbers are free of charge. If you do not have a cell
        phone, you can ask a staff member.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging
        to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is
        that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders,
        and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. PyCon CZ
        staff request that they be your first resource when reporting a
        PyCon-related incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and
        take quick action towards a solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to Max Kovykov.
      </p>
