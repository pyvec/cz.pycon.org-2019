      PyCon CZ (Czech Republic) 2018 is pleased to announce that its Call for
      Proposals is now open! The conference this year will be held from Friday,
      June 1 to Sunday, June 3. The main conference is held on Friday
      and Saturday. Sunday will host developer sprints and workshops.
    </p>

    <h2>Important dates</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Call for Proposals opens: Wednesday, January 17</li>
      <li>Proposal submission deadline: Wednesday, February 28</li>
      {% comment %}<li>Proposal acceptance: Sunday, March 11</li>{% endcomment %}
    </ul>

    <p>
      PyCon CZ attracts professional developers, test engineers and localization
      and documentation specialists from all walks of life, including industry,
      government and science, as well as enthusiasts and students. We’re looking
      for proposals for presentations and workshops on any aspect of Python
      programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or
      commercial projects, or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation
      is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for
      inclusion in the program. We're especially interested in short presentations
      that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show
      attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an
      application? Do you have inspiring lessons learned to share?
    </p>

    <h2>First-time speakers</h2>

    <p>
      We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference eager to hear about your experience. 
      If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, 
      twist their arms to tell us about it!
      Also, please forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be
      interested.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaker benefits</h2>

    <p>
      All speakers will receive ONE free conference ticket automatically. As a
      speaker, if you or your organisation can afford to register and purchase a
      ticket anyway at full price, please do! All such payments will go directly
      towards our financial assistance pool to help people who could not otherwise
      afford to attend the conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will not be automatically registered as an attendee for the conference;
      you will need to register yourself when ticket sales are open. Don't worry, we will let you know.
    </p>

    <h2>Financial assistance</h2>

    <p>
      PyCon CZ offers a generous financial assistance programme, so that some
      attendees and speakers have some -- or in rare cases, all -- of their
      expenses, such as flight, hotel and admission, provided to them from the
      conference budget.
    </p>

    <p>
      PyCon CZ strongly encourages those in need to apply for
      financial assistance -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses,
      we will try our best to at least give you a discounted admission! The
      application process is simple and straightforward. It’s also very
      liberal. {% comment %}Apply for a grant on the <a href="{% url "proposal_about" key="financial-aid" %}">
