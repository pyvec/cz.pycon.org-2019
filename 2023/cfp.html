                        <p>If money is the only thing stopping you from speaking at PyCon CZ, we'll try to help. It wouldn't be in a true community spirit if somebody wouldn't come to PyCon CZ just because their budget is tight at the moment.</p>
                        <p>That's why we provide financial aid to those who wouldn't be able to attend otherwise. It helps cover travel, accommodation, and anything else you need to contribute to the conference.</p>
                        <p>While we do our best, our budget is limited so we have to find a balance between how great your contribution to PyCon CZ would be and how much it would cost us.</p>
                        <p>Please don't let this stop you from submitting as we should be able to cover expenses of most speakers. Just fill out the relevant field in the <a href="">submission form</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Public Speaking Mentorship</h3>
                    <p>If you're just starting your public speaking adventure, apply! Regardless of your technical experience, we can pair you with a mentor to help you hone your skills. We offer support in two areas: preparing the proposal, and preparing the talk itself.</p>

                    <h3>Childcare</h3>
                    <p>We will offer free childcare at the venue. During the conference hours, there will be a dedicated area with childcare professionals who will look after your children.</p>
                    <p>Please reach out to <a href="mailto:info@pycon.cz">info@pycon.cz</a> if you have questions regarding speaker support.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Do you have more than one idea?</h2>
                    <p>Great! Submit all of them. Each proposal will be evaluated separately. You can indicate in your proposal the maximum number of talks you're willing to do, in case multiple of your submissions would be selected. We will choose those most fitting our audience.</p>

                    <h2>Want to promote your commercial project?</h2>
                    <p>PyCon CZ is a community conference with open-source at heart. We’re happy to learn from each other and hear from anyone who got their hands deep in Python-related projects. Be careful with blatant marketing, though — those talks usually aren’t as appreciated.</p>

                    <h2>Eager to learn more?</h2>
                    <p>You will find some advice for writing great proposals in our <a href="https://cz.pycon.org/2023/cfp-guide/">CfP Guide.</a></p>
                    <p>We also recommend reading tips at <a href="https://speaking.io/">speaking.io</a>. It covers many aspects of speaking at a tech conference including choosing the right topic.</p>

                    <h3>Non-Profit & Organized by Volunteers</h3>
                    <p>PyCon CZ is organized by volunteers. All proceeds go to Pyvec, a non-profit service organization supporting a variety of Python communities across the Czech Republic. Please consider supporting Pyvec via <a href="https://cz.pycon.org/2023/sponsors/">PyCon CZ sponsorships</a>.</p>
