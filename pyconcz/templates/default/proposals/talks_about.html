        <h2>What we’re looking for</h2>

        <p>PyCon CZ attracts professional developers, test engineers and localization and documentation specialists from all walks of life, including industry, government and science, as well as enthusiasts and students. We’re looking for proposals for presentations and workshops on any aspect of Python programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.</p>

        <p>Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects, or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program. We're especially interested in short presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application? Do you have inspiring lessons learned to share?</p>


        <h2>First-time speakers</h2>

        <p>We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it! Also, please forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested.</p>

        <h2>Speaker benefits</h2>

        <p>All speakers will receive <b>one</b> free conference ticket automatically. As a speaker, if you or your organisation can afford to register and purchase a ticket anyway at full price, please do! All such payments will go directly towards our financial assistance pool to help people who could not otherwise afford to attend the conference.</p>

        <p>You will not be automatically registered as an attendee for the conference; you will need to register yourself when ticket sales are open. Don't worry, we will let you know.</p>


        <h2>Financial assistance</h2>

        <p>PyCon CZ offers a generous financial assistance programme, so that some attendees and speakers have some — or in rare cases, all — of their expenses, such as flight, hotel and admission, provided to them from the conference budget.</p>

        <p>PyCon CZ strongly encourages those in need to apply for financial assistance – even if we can’t cover all of your expenses, we will try our best to help! The application process is simple and straightforward. It’s also very liberal.</p>


        <h2>Talk format</h2>

        <p>The preferred length for talks is 30 minutes. We also accept extended proposals for tutorials and workshops of 90 minutes or three hours. However, if you need something special, don’t hesitate to ask! We’ll do what we can to accommodate.</p>

        <p>Session length include time for questions from the audience. You should keep at least five minutes for questions; for example, a 30-minute talk could comprise 25 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of questions.</p>


        <h2>Presentation recording</h2>

        <p>Every session at PyCon CZ will have professional video recordings to release on our media channels. If you do not wish to have your talk recorded then please note this in your submission. Doing so will not influence the selection process in any way. You have the option to change your mind at any time.</p>
