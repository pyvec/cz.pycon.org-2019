            <h2>History of Ostrava</h2>

            <p>
                You can still visit Ostrava’s 14<sup>th</sup>-century <i>old city hall</i>, now turned into the Ostrava Museum.
                Back then, Ostrava was just a&nbsp;few buildings.
                But the industrial revolution in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries demanded factories, and around them, the city grew.
                As a&nbsp;coal mining site and Central Europe’s main centre of iron, coke and steel production, Ostrava became a&nbsp;unique industrial complex.
                It was the only area in Europe where you could find such technological flow all in one place.
                Products made here are part of Paris’ Eiffel Tower or Australia’s biggest bridge.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>
                        Ostrava’s dominant unspoiled feature is the Vítkovice area (DOV) with the <i>Hlubina</i> mine complex, blast furnaces, ironworks, and a&nbsp;coke plant.
                        DOV was placed on Czechia’s list of tentative World Heritage sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a&nbsp;key industrial area during the communist era, Ostrava was nicknamed the “steel heart of the Republic”.
                        Architecture in the socialist realism style sprang up along with fountained parks, plane trees and statues of a&nbsp;shining future for working men and women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coal production ended in 1998 and the city went through a&nbsp;lot of modernisation in the past years.
                        Nowadays, Ostrava is known for cultural events, festivals, and sports events.
                        Almost every day, there’s a&nbsp;new place opening: galleries, cafés, bars or bistros.
                        The people are open and direct, and very warm at the same time.

                            Due to coal burning inside this slag heap, it is green and full of life even in the winter.
                            It is very popular for walks during the day or nights, and offers beautiful views of the city and the nearby Beskydy mountains.

                        Many parking spaces in the city center are paid.
                        If there is a&nbsp;payment machine nearby, be sure to use it.

                    <p>
                        A planned zone system will probably limit parking for visitors in the city center. We will update the information here according to the current situation.

            <h2>The Czech Republic</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Never been to the Czech Republic? Here are a&nbsp;few useful facts.
            </p>

            <p>
                The country’s official names are <strong>Czech Republic</strong> (Česká republika) and <strong>Czechia</strong> (Česko).
                A country named <i>Czechoslovakia</i> doesn’t exist anymore – it split up 26 years ago.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                    <h3>Money</h3>
                    <p>
                        We pay with <strong>CZK</strong> (“koruna”, also abbreviated <strong>Kč</strong>).
                        <br>
                        ATMs are omnipresent, but avoid <i>Euronet</i> because of their high fees.
                        <br>
                        Money exchange booths sometimes offer smaller fees and better deals than banks, but some are tourist traps.
                        Be cautious when choosing.
                        <br>
                        Closest ATM to the main venue is a 5-minute walk outside of “Malý svět techniky U6”.
                        <br>
                        The exchange rate is approximately 1&nbsp;EUR&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;CZK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s useful to carry some <strong>cash</strong> around.
                        Cards (mostly Visa and Mastercard) are accepted in chain stores and larger places, but less often in smaller shops, coffee places or pubs.

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        We speak <strong>Czech</strong> and generally understand Slovak perfectly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>English</strong> should be well understood, especially among younger people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>German</strong> or a&nbsp;Slavic language like <strong>Polish</strong> can work as a&nbsp;fallback.

                        It can be 30°C with a&nbsp;clear blue sky as well as 15°C with heavy, London-like rain.
