      Humanizing among coders

    <p class="talk-description">What makes a good developer? Certainly technical expertise, insightfulness, creativity, thoughtfulness. What about daily social interactions with other developers inside the company and community? Those are never easy. Even though we all try to be nice to each other, sometimes unintentionally we can be a bit off. I&#39;d like to share with you some stories that helped me rationalize some of my own communication and human interaction mistakes and how I&#39;m trying to correct them.</p>

            <p class="bio">Andrej is searching for the ultimate tricorder, a device which can see and tell your health, discover dangers in your environment and enhance your senses to cyborg levels. His first professional project was to build a chromatographic column to extract elements from human blood plasma. He created the first open source spectrometer, which was then distributed to all corners of Earth and above, launching from ISS station onboard two microsatellites. Andrej advocates micropython, Python for small microcontrollers which allows for prototyping of electronic devices at unprecedented speeds. His dream is to create the tricorder for the first man on Mars.</p>

      Python embedded in your daily life
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Have you always wondered where the batteries from Python: batteries included are? Despair no more! We come with battery-powered Python devices for your daily life.<br />We will focus on showcasing and live demonstration of Python running on very small microprocessors. <br />First, an overview of existing platforms which can run Python on batteries. Then we will showcase in a live demo what Python can do for you. Finally a “how to” workflow for successful Python coding on low power ARM Cortex microprocessors will be revealed to get you started.</p>

      Do You Want to Retry? Handling Network Failures
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">The world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining about instability might not always be enough. Especially when your system depends on multiple networked services and each of them is on a critical path to the final result.<br /><br />In this talk we will recall why network failures happen. Reason what we can and cannot handle in the code. And see what Python standard libraries and a few popular ones such as urllib3 and requests can offer. <br /><br />And that&#39;s not all. Network Emulation (netem) module of Linux Traffic Control (tc) can even help with poor network simulation.<br /><br />Now there is no excuse.</p>

      How Fedora uses Python data analytics to understand and help the community.
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">I have been involved with Fedora Community Operations Team from its conception one year ago. Amongst other things we at CommOps are trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and the insights we have generated from them.</p>

      TMOU, puzzlehunts &amp; cracking (im)possible problems with Python
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Do you like codes, riddles and ciphers? Some people have turned cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem. This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.<br /><br />I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:<br /> - What makes a problem seemingly impossible<br /> - How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard<br /> - How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity<br /> - Why Python might be a good hammer for that<br /><br />Follow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the final design (puzzle #4 &quot;the Dice&quot;, TMOU 17 http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?</p>

      GIL: What&#39;s the hassle and why should I care?
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Demistifying GIL - what&#39;s that, how it really affects performance, what changed in the last few years and what can we do about GIL in everyday programming.<br /><br />There is still a lot of misunderstanding regarding GIL, coming from not-so-perfect documentation - not explaining the implications thoroughly and in a simple way; it&#39;s also often outdated.<br /><br />Also, GIL&#39;s implementation changed a little in CPython 3.x that may affect programmers&#39; choices.<br /><br />This misinformation may, in some cases, drive them away from CPython where it&#39;s not really the worst choice. By providing comprehensive guide to today&#39;s GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop Python entirely.<br /><br />There have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of which is Larry Hasting&#39;s project called GILectomy, which I hope to shed some light on.</p>

      User-centered software projects
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Open-sourced and inner-sourced projects often struggle to get engagement. Communities, such as Github and PyPi, are host to redundant projects and libraries. In the development space, how do you distinguish your project from others, get people excited to contribute to it, and ultimately create a successful open source project? The answer is to apply user-centered design techniques to the development of your project. User-centered design is usually applied to web applications and products on the front-end of a website, but these techniques can be applied to open source libraries. In user-centered open source projects, your users are those who type `pip install $your_library`. In this talk, Jackie will illustrate some user-centered techniques that have been used on her own project - Mesa (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), along with other successful open source projects.</p>

During our talk we will share the story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started the community in a small country like Albania and what other small cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in developing a Python community in similar conditions.<br />Most important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other communities to make the first steps or grow even further.

      If it Moves, Test it Anyway
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">So you have written a nice piece of code that does something on the Internetz: communicates with a web API, or gets a webpage and parses some important information from it.<br /><br />Now you write tests and you want them to be part of the project, run on your CI etc., but:<br /><br /> * the API is secured by a secret token/password/cookie...<br /> * the information on the webpage changes<br /> * it&#39;s not even accessible from the wild web<br /><br />So how do you test it? You can mock the server part (that&#39;s messy), you can spin off your own testing server (that&#39;s hard) or you can record the HTTP communication with betamax (that&#39;s super simple). I&#39;ll show you all the methods and their good, bad and ugly parts.</p>

      Doksit - Generování dokumentace z kódu
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">V dnešní době je, dá se říci, zavedeným standardem psát dokumentaci pro Pythoní projekty v ReStructured Textu (ReST) s použitím balíčku Sphinx. Na obou nástrojích je ale vidět jejich zastaralost. <br /><br />Místo ReSTu je daleko snažší používat Markdown a co se týče Sphinxu, tak psát pro něj rozšíření není zrovna procházka růžovým sadem. Jednodušší alternativou ke Sphinxu je MkDocs, jenže ten se zaměřuje jen na psanou prózu (mimo kódy) a chybí mu API generátor dokumentace. Tento problém by se dal vyřešit přes modul Pydoc, ale to není taky žádná sláva. <br /><br />Můj projekt, doksit, spojuje tyto dva přístupy: <br />1. vytáhne dokumentační řetězce z kódu, sestaví z nich Markdown soubor a <br />2. pokud existují k tomu i psané prózy (tutoriály aj.), vytvoří uvnitř repozitáře na GitHubu triviální &quot;readthedocs&quot; portál (do budoucna integrace s MkDocs). <br /><br />Na přednášce představím existujících knihovny a jejich problémy, ukážu, co vše zatím doksit umí, jak ho použít a kam bude směřovat jeho další vývoj, do kterého se můžeš zapojit i ty.</p>

      API first and forgotten
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">&quot;API first&quot; principle seems convincing. Anyone who tried implementing it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to remember and which tools are worth to check.<br /><br />The talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable. <br />I will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover technical problems we encountered:<br />* how to test that a service implements an API;<br />* how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;<br />* how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.<br /><br />As theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help, describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to implement microservices integration tests @Growbots.</p>

      Tom&#39;s super easy way to make basic user interfaces in Python
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Horetu (https://pythonhosted.org/horetu) exposes Python functions as command-line interfaces, web interfaces, and configuration files. In addition to being a very practical tool, horetu is interesting because its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function objects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and detailed documentation from functions that were written with no intent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear demonstration of the merits of following conventions.</p>

            <p class="bio">Původně Veronika vystudovala zdravotní školu a rýsovalo se životní poslání sloužit lidu. Poté ale zjistila, že programování je mnohem větší zábava a moc lidí při tom obvykle neumírá, a tak otočila o 180°, směrem do IT. S pythonisty se poprvé střetla v roce 2015 na DjangoGirls a dál se učila hadí jazyk na intenzivním kurzu PyLadies v Praze. Aktuálně pracuje v MSD IT Prague, kde v cloudovém teamu krotí AWSko za pomoci Pythonu. Pomáhá organizovat akce v rámci Pyvce, především PyLadies v Praze. Jejím novým životním posláním se stalo šířit lásku k Pythonu a pomáhat dalším lidem, nováčkům, se jej také učit a začlenit se do jeho komunity.</p>

      Jak na chov Pythonů, aby nám nevyhynuli

    <p class="talk-description">Pohovořím o aktuálním tématu a přiblížím pohled začátečnice a organizátorky kurzů pro jiné začátečníky. Každý jednou začínal a možnosti pomoci začít i dalším se díky PyLadies a naucse.python.cz velmi posunuly. Předvedu, jak lze jednoduchou aplikací již vytvořených materiálů a bohatého know-how organizátorů různých měst učit Python zase další lidi. Jaký přínos z toho koučové mají a co to přináší celé komunitě a hlavně začátečníkům. Nastíním základní know-how v několika bodech a znázorním, proč není vůbec životně důležité nejprve 3 roky programovat Fibonacciho a faktorial!, ale je lepší zajistit dostatek reálných projektů. Ukážu, co jsem zvládla za jeden rok (jakožto bývalá PyLady, která si procesem prošla a nyní programuje v MSD IT), kam obvykle směřují mé otázky a co mě jako začátečníka naopak vůbec neláká a neposouvá v práci dál.</p>

      Because Web API Testing Should Be Easy
    </span>
    <p class="talk-description">Web APIs are often called REST APIs, which recently became a part of the everyday life of many Python developers. Sure, it can be a blast to build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code, set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill. Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we&#39;ve developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has baked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting and boring stuff<br />for you while allowing you to alter the test cases with arbitrary Python code.<br /><br />Let Judge Dredd do your API justice.</p>

I can hardly even recall working in a non-agile project. I feel that most of the Agile manifesto principles are in my DNA more than a thing to follow. If you want to keep growing in this industry you might want to start building on top of that.
