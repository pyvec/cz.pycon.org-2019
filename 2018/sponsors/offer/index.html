        <h2 id="the-short-version">Objective and Mission</h2>

        <p>The objective of the conference is to raise participants’ qualifications, and overall integration of the Python Programmers’ Community in Czech Republic and surrounding area, popularisation of new applications of the language as well as to spread good programming practices and exchange of experiences between professionals, novices, students and hobbyist Python programmers. PyCon&nbsp;CZ events are also fantastic networking opportunities and a great place to find interesting Python jobs or
            community projects to work on.</p>


        <h2 id="the-short-version">Target Audience</h2>

        <p>The conference is addressed to all Python programmers, experienced and novices alike. Presentations will cover a wide range of topics relevant to students, professionals, and hobbyists. Women who are interested to learn more about Python can also participate in DjangoGirls. Altogether, we are expecting more than 400 participants this year. The majority are likely to be Czech locals. With Brno and Czech Republic so centrally located in EU though, and the fact that the Czech organizer team is so
            diverse and well connected, you can expect many visitors from Slovakia, Austria, Poland, Germany, Hungary, UK and more as well.</p>
